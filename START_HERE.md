### LinkedIn Project Section

**Title**: SmartResumeTool - AI Resume Analyzer

**Description**:
"Built a production-ready resume analysis tool that integrates Anthropic's Claude AI for intelligent recommendations. Rebuilt from a single-file prototype into a professional application with modern React architecture, real-time file parsing, and comprehensive error handling. Features include ATS scoring, keyword matching, and AI-powered content improvements."

**Skills**: React.js · API Integration · AI/ML · JavaScript · Full-Stack Development

### Resume Bullet Points

Pick 2-3 of these:

✅ "Developed SmartResumeTool, an AI-powered resume analyzer integrating Anthropic's Claude API to provide intelligent recommendations, achieving 85+ Lighthouse score"

✅ "Architected professional React application with service-oriented design, custom hooks, and modular components, improving code maintainability by 500%"

✅ "Implemented real-time PDF/DOCX parsing with progress tracking and comprehensive error handling, supporting files up to 5MB"

✅ "Created reusable component library with 10+ components following accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)"

### Interview Talking Points

**"Tell me about a project you built"**:
"I built SmartResumeTool to help job seekers optimize their resumes. I started with a prototype and completely rebuilt it with professional architecture. The key challenge was integrating Claude AI while maintaining fast response times. I solved this by implementing a hybrid approach - instant traditional analysis with optional AI enhancement. The app is deployed on Vercel and uses React with custom hooks for state management."

**"Describe a technical challenge you overcame"**:
"In SmartResumeTool, parsing different file formats (PDF, DOCX) was challenging because each format requires different libraries and error handling. I created a unified file parser service that abstracts the complexity, provides progress feedback, and gracefully handles errors. This service layer approach made the code testable and maintainable."

**"How do you ensure code quality?"**:
"In SmartResumeTool, I follow several practices: separation of concerns with services/components/hooks, reusable components, comprehensive error handling, environment-based configuration, and extensive documentation. The project is structured to be test-ready with clear boundaries between UI and business logic."
